TECHNICAL MEMO 2014.07.18

Look, all you code kiddies, I don't have time for this open source nonsense. The people I manage, they don't spend a minute of time on this side, and they like it. Unfortunately, the geeks in marketing tell me that this whole open source fad is good for our image, so they made this repository on Git-hub. I don't know exactly what this website is, but all I know is the people who told me to use it have more in common with the former part of the word than the latter.  

Marketing wants this to be our next big thing, so I've hired on some more of you software kids to program some open source software. 

Now get to it! I want to see a lot of lines of code!
